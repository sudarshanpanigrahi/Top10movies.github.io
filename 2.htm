            <h3><i>Army Of The Dead</i></h3>
            <p>A road accident compromises a confidential payload transported by the US Military from the famous Area 51. 
                The container unleashes a metahuman zombie who not only kills the soldiers but also infects the nearby Las Vegas city. 
                In order to protect the country, the US government quarantines the city, locking the zombies inside it.</p><p>
                A band of mercenaries, carrying guns and grenades helped the government to seal the city, but after the work was done, 
                their efforts were ignored and abandoned. The head mercenary, Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) now lives an infamous life, 
                flipping burgers. His life was mundane until the owner of the Las Vegas Casino, Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) 
                offers him a job to extract 200 million dollars from his casino’s vault situated at the heart of the quarantined Zombie City. 
                To support his daughter’s future, Scott gambles upon his life. He assembles his team of bandits recruiting his old pals and helping hands needed for the mission.</p><p>            
                However, the US government plans on nuking the entire city in the next 96 hours, and hence, Scott needs to make fast decisions. 
                His future depends on it. But once they enter the Zombie city, the new challenges and the Zombie Kingdom amp up the conflict. 
                There is much more in store for them than just wads of cash.</p>
