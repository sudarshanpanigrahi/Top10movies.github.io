        <h3><i>777 Charlie Story</i></h3>
            <p>777 Charlie is an emotional comedy-drama movie directed by Kiranraj K. 
                The movie casts Rakshit Shetty and Sangeetha Sringeri are in the lead roles along with Raj B Shetty, 
                Danish Sait, Bobby Simha, and many others are seen in supporting roles. 
                The music was composed by Nobin Paul while cinematography is done by Arvind S Kashyap and is edited by Pratheek Shetty. 
                The film is produced by G S Gupta and Rakshit Shetty under Brindavan Enterprises banner.</p>
        <h3><i>STORYLINES</i></h3>
            <p>The hero is not much of a hero in the initial stages of the film. 
                Having lost his parents and sister when he was nearing his preteens, 
                the orphan boy turns into a people and animal hater as an adult. 
                No chit-chat with the neighbours, no small talk - just living the 
                life of a sloth in a messy house and his own lonesome self for company.</p><P>
                Even as a machinist in a factory, he stays within himself and keeps to the surly and rude routine. 
                The decidedly anti-social, Dharma (Rakshit Shetty) begins metamorphosing into a more rounded individual 
                when an adorable abandoned light beige hued labrador walks into his life and heart. Though it isn't love at first sight, 
                they learn to accept each other eventually. And just when you think it's gonna be a happily ever after, 
                the narrative hits you smack in the face with a terminal illness. No, not Dharma, 
                it's Charlie who is ill and Dharma takes up the challenge of taking Charlie all the way to the extreme north of India to experience some snow.</P>
